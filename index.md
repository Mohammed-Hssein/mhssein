## Welcome to my personal web page

I am a Data science engineer and machine learning master level research student at [**ENS Paris-Saclay**](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/). I graduated recently from [**École Centrale de Lille**](https://centralelille.fr/). I am poursuing a master of research in machine learning known in France to be the ***"MVA : Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage"***, or in english ***"Mathematics, Vision, and Learning"***. Please find [here](https://www.master-mva.com/) the programm.



### Experience

> **Fundamental Machine Learning**

I worked for 8 months on a theritical machine learning subject, which is the problem of `Early Stopping`.
Early stopping refers to in which time one should interupt iterative algorithms such as gradient descent, or its variants (as the momentum, Nestorov, Adam, ... etc), so that we can guarantee at the same time good fit to the data, and keep high generalization capabilities (Bias-Variance dilemma !). The phenomenon of early stopping acts therfore as an *algorithmic* regularization.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Mohammed-Hssein/mhssein/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
